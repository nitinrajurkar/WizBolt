# WizBolt
A bolting software to calculate tensioning to fit or unscrew the bolts from flanges (usually very large).
This software caters to all the standards including ASME/ANSI, NORSOK, etc.

##Operation
It allows user to define a joint in say several pipelines. A joint is two flanges joined together using bolts.
Then user can select a standard specification such as ASME/ANSI, API, or NORSOK (and sub categories) or custom.
Select flange type, bolt size, threads.

Software provide you the tool for tensioning, calculate residual stress, pressure, torque, de-tensioning, plot a graph, provide tensile stress, calculate bolt length, provide pass sequence, and many more calculations and details.
